# Project 3 of Hacking With SwiftUI

## About the Project

Built a custom View Modifier (with an accompanying View extension) that makes a view have large, blue font for prominent titles.

This project covers a lot about views and modifiers, why SwiftUI uses structs for views, the fact that there is nothing behind a view, why modifier order matters, why `some View` is useful, conditional and environmental modifiers, views as properties, view composition, and custom modifiers.

Xcode, SwiftUI

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install XCode

### Getting the files onto your computer

Clone this repository to a desired location on your computer using Git or GitHub Desktop. 

For example, this is how using git could potentially look like: 
```
https://github.com/your_username/project_name.git
```

You should replace `your_username` and `project_name` respectively.

### Running the project

1. Get started by opening up the project in XCode by clicking on the file ending with `.xcodeproj`.
2. Once the project is open in Xcode, you can select a device (ex. iPhone 15) and run it on a simulator by pressing Cmd + R or clicking on the play button at the top-left corner of the screen.
